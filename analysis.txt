Method            ArrayList Runtime       LinkedList Runtime
add(T element)    O(1) best, O(n) worst   O(1)
Explanation: Arrays have to resize, so they have to go through whole array,
singly linked lists just add on at the end being faster during those times
getMin() method   O(n)                    O(n)
Explanation: both have to iterate through whole list to find minimum
removeDuplicates  O(n^2)                  O(n^2)
Explanation: both have to iterate through list again each time you are checking for a element
reverse()         O(n)                    O(n)
Explanation: both can be reversed with one iteration,
technically array is faster since they only traverse half the array and just swap using mirror logic
