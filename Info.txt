Levi Eby <eby00009>: Wrote ArrayList class
Minh Nguyen <nguy5571>: Wrote LinkedList class
Assumptions:
    In ArrayList.intersect(List other) other and this have no duplicates
    (though it won't really matter. the duplicates from 'this' will stay and other's will not)
Additional features: 
    ArrayList.checkIsSorted() checks the list to see if it is sorted when isSorted is false. updates isSorted if so
    ArrayList constructor can also take an array as a parameter and it initializes its data as the data in the array
Bugs:
